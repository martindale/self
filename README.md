# self
Personal self-improvement.  Have a constructive criticism?  [File it in the tracker][submit-issue].

## What is this?
While noodling on radical transparency, I thought it would be useful to track the time and history of my self-improvement efforts.  This led to the idea of creating a public issue tracker, where feedback can be provided pseudononymously, but publicly.  This also gives me an opportunity to respond in public, as well.

## What's next?
I'm not sure yet.  We'll see how this goes.
